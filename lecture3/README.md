# Python Variables

In this lab you will learn about variables in Python.

## Variables

- A variable is data that can change.
- The type of a variable is determined by Python.
- A variable's value can change when a program is executed.

## Assignment statement

A variable is created the first time it is assigned a value.  To assign a variable to a value, we use the = sign.  

Let's test this idea out in Python Interactive Mode.  In the CS50 Terminal, type: python
